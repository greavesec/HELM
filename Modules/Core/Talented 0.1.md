Talents are special abilities that you may select to provide additional customization to your character. These are minor spells and maneuvers that may be flavored however you wish, but they all have specific effects that can influence the course of an event.
# Rules
- The default number of talents you may select is based on your character's skill level. This may be influenced by items or events:
	- Novice: 1 talent.
	- Journeyman and above: 2 talents.
- You may use your talents alongside items and your standard roll.
- You may use as many talents during your phase as you wish.
- You may only use a talent once per phase.
- If a talent activates during the world phase, you may only use one of such talents per phase.
- You may only change your talents between events.
## Starting Talents
The novice and master skill levels start with specific talents. These talents *cannot* be selected manually, and do not count against your maximum number of talents.
